# GlamDB

An open-source C++23 columnar key-value storage engine in early development.

GlamDB combines Arrow batches, immutable Parquet files, Iceberg snapshots, and a
persistent SQLite catalog. The C++ core owns writes, commit ordering, recovery,
and snapshot reads; the native HTTP server and clients use that same core.

The first engine milestone is an embedded, synchronous **append store** on
Linux and local persistent storage, with one owning process and one writer.
Append preserves duplicate keys. Key-value upserts and deletes follow after
local durability qualification, with further network capabilities and S3
as separate extensions.
See the [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for semantics and the
[roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md) for scope and acceptance criteria.

## Current status

The SQLite catalog, write/recovery coordinator, canonical Arrow input, public
C++ facade, outcome JSON and network CLI are implemented. Independent
storage primitives implement durable local I/O, Parquet writing, Iceberg append
staging, publication validation, reachable-file recovery, and capacity checks.
Tests cover real files, injected failures and fresh-process recovery.

A storage backend connecting these primitives to the coordinator and a minimal
scanner (`Engine::Scan`) are implemented and tested through `glamdb_vertical`;
see [SCANNER.md](docs/development/SCANNER.md).
The [installed public API consumer](docs/development/BUILDING.md#build-and-install)
checks real A/B appends, fixed-view scans, persisted receipts and retries after
reopening in a new process, with a separate storage-disabled contour.
See the [coordinator guide](docs/development/COORDINATOR.md)
and [storage guide](docs/development/STORAGE_MODULE.md) for supported boundaries.
The [shared resource budget matrix](docs/development/RESOURCE_BUDGETS.md) names
limit units, owners and enforcement points, including retained buffers and
completion/recovery reserves. It separates existing local checks from aggregate
memory and device reservations still required for a bounded process.
Power-loss and load qualification are deferred.

Available now: independent golden fixtures, a typed SQL-NULL reference oracle,
receipt/fault-evidence tools, a network Python SDK, and a configurable pink
browser workbench. The [native HTTP server](docs/development/HTTP_SERVER.md)
connects them to persistent storage and serves the same UI. It supports typed
create/append/scan operations, JSON and Arrow, with explicit capabilities for
unavailable metadata/explain APIs. A separate **disposable in-memory mock**
remains available for development. Its data files,
snapshots and commits are synthetic and disappear on restart.

The workbench also has a **public browser demo** requiring no token or Python
server. Each page instance owns its sample data; visitors can create/append,
filter, explore snapshots and export JSON. Reload resets only that visitor's
demo. See [public demo and publishing](docs/development/PUBLIC_DEMO.md).
The supplied wordmark/transparent mark are used in login, sidebar, avatar and
favicon; artwork paths and sizes remain runtime theme settings.

**[Open the public demo](https://nnrpi.github.io/glamdb/)** — anyone can try it.

For persistent data, [run the native server locally](#run-locally).
Launch the disposable mock workbench (Python 3.13 and Node 22+):

```sh
bash scripts/bootstrap-workbench.sh
export GLAMDB_TOKEN='choose-a-local-development-token'
.venv/bin/python -m glamdb_mock --ui-dir ui --seed-demo
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8765** and enter that token. Edit
[`ui/config/theme.json`](ui/config/theme.json) for live colors, fonts, layout,
branding and bows/sparkles/kisses. No compilation or restart is needed.

See the [workbench guide](docs/development/WORKBENCH.md),
[SDK](sdk/python/README.md), [independent tools](tools/verification/README.md),
[adapter contract](docs/development/HTTP_MOCK_CONTRACT.md), and
[validation report](docs/development/WORKBENCH_VALIDATION.md).

## Run locally

The native server `glamdb` keeps databases in `--data-dir` (an absolute path with
an existing parent) and serves the workbench from `--ui-root`. Its bearer token
comes only from `GLAMDB_TOKEN`. Creating collections and appending need at least
max(1 GiB, 5% of the data filesystem) plus 512 MiB free, otherwise they fail with
HTTP 507 `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.

On Linux (GCC 14+ or Clang 18+, CMake 3.28+, Ninja, OpenSSL and zlib headers),
build the pinned dependencies once (30–60 minutes), then the server and CLI:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake --preset deps-local && cmake --build --preset deps-local --parallel 2
cmake --preset release && cmake --build --preset release --target glamdb_server glamdb_cli
export GLAMDB_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
./build/release/apps/server/glamdb --data-dir "$HOME/glamdb-data" --ui-root "$PWD/ui"
```

On macOS, build and run the same Linux binaries in Docker
([Colima setup](docs/development/BUILDING.md#linux-tests-with-docker); give its VM
enough disk). The server listens on all container interfaces, published to host loopback:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/build-deps-in-docker.sh   # once: images and the dependency volume
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src:ro" -v glamdb-build:/build \
  --mount type=volume,src=glamdb-deps-clang18,dst=/prefix,readonly,volume-subpath=install \
  -w /src glamdb-deps:clang18 sh -c 'cmake --preset release -B /build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/prefix &&
    cmake --build /build --parallel 2 --target glamdb_server glamdb_cli'
export GLAMDB_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 16)
docker run --rm --name glamdb -e GLAMDB_TOKEN -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 \
  -v "$PWD/ui:/ui:ro" -v glamdb-build:/build:ro -v glamdb-data:/data glamdb-deps:clang18 \
  /build/apps/server/glamdb --data-dir /data/glamdb --listen 0.0.0.0 --ui-root /ui
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:8080** and enter the token (`echo $GLAMDB_TOKEN`). Data
survives restarts. From another shell with the same `GLAMDB_TOKEN` exported
(int64 values are decimal strings):

```sh
curl -sS http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz; echo   # public liveness, "mock":false
api() { curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $GLAMDB_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' "http://127.0.0.1:8080$@"; echo; }
api /capabilities
api /databases -d '{"name":"demo","database_id":"11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111"}'
D=/databases/11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111
api $D/collections -d '{"collection_id":"22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222","name":"events",
  "schema":{"fields":[{"name":"key","type":"string","nullable":false},{"name":"n","type":"int64","nullable":true}]}}'
C=$D/collections/22222222-2222-4222-8222-222222222222
api $C/append -d '{"operation_id":"33333333-3333-4333-8333-333333333333","rows":[{"key":"a","n":"1"},{"key":"b"}]}'
api $C/scan -d '{}'
```

`glamdb-cli request --path ROUTE [--body FILE]` calls the same routes:

```sh
./build/release/apps/cli/glamdb-cli request --path /databases
docker exec -e GLAMDB_TOKEN glamdb /build/apps/cli/glamdb-cli request --path /databases   # macOS
```

See the [server guide](docs/development/HTTP_SERVER.md) for all routes and the
[CLI guide](apps/cli/README.md) for HTTPS and Arrow output.

## Build and test

With the pinned dependencies from [Run locally](#run-locally), build and test
the native C++ core on Linux:

```sh
cmake --preset local
cmake --build --preset local
ctest --preset local
```

On macOS, `./scripts/test-in-docker.sh asan-ubsan` tests independent I/O in Linux
without the full dependency prefix. To include the engine and storage adapters:

```sh
./scripts/build-deps-in-docker.sh
./scripts/test-storage-in-docker.sh asan-ubsan
```

The full build installs `glamdb::core` and public headers. Storage adapters
(`GLAMDB_BUILD_STORAGE`) are on by default; `GLAMDB_IO_ONLY=ON` provides a separate
lightweight build. See the build guide for Docker setup.

Store readiness is available through authenticated
`GET /databases/{id}/readyz` (legacy single-store mode: `/readyz`) and scoped
capabilities. It reports read availability separately from write readiness;
`/healthz` remains process liveness. All backends explicitly remain
`durability_qualified=false`. See the [health contract](docs/development/HTTP_SERVER.md).
