# GlamDB Python network SDK

This package talks only to the public HTTP endpoints. It does not import
the C++ core, a Python storage writer, the development mock, or verification
tools. The native server manages databases; a disposable mock adapter is also
available. Passing SDK tests does not establish storage durability.

Install from this directory with `python -m pip install .`. Dependencies are
HTTPX 0.28 and PyArrow 25; Python 3.10 or later is required. For local development,
`python -m pip install -e '.[test]'` installs the tests as well.

```python
from uuid import UUID
from glamdb_sdk import Client, Field, Schema, col

# Generate and persist these UUIDs in your application BEFORE sending a write.
collection_id = UUID("00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff")
operation_id = UUID("aaaaaaaa-bbbb-4ccc-8ddd-eeeeeeeeeeee")
schema = Schema([
    Field("key", "string", False),
    Field("n", "int64", True),
    Field("at", "timestamp_us_utc", True),
])

with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8080", token="your-token") as admin:
    database = admin.create_database("analytics")  # same name reuses the same ID
    print(admin.list_databases().items)

with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8080", token="your-token",
            database_id=database["database_id"]) as client:
    created = client.create_collection("example", schema, collection_id=collection_id)
    if created.outcome != "committed":
        raise RuntimeError(created.raw)

    request = client.prepare_append(collection_id, [
        {"key": "same-key", "n": 9007199254740993, "at": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},
        {"key": "same-key", "n": None, "at": None},
    ], operation_id=operation_id, schema=schema)
    outcome = client.append(request, deadline=60)
    print(outcome.outcome, request.operation_id, request.payload_hash)

    result = client.scan_json(collection_id, predicate=col("n", "int64").ge(9007199254740993))
    print(result.rows)  # Python int and timezone-aware UTC datetime values

    with client.scan_batches(collection_id) as stream:
        for batch in stream:
            print(batch.to_pylist())
    print(stream.snapshot_id, stream.integrity, stream.checksum_verified)
```

`get_database`, `open_database`, `close_database` and `reconcile_database` accept
a database UUID. `database_id=` scopes collection requests and capabilities while
management calls remain at the server root. Keep a separate client per database:
schema caches and open streams belong to that client's selection. Omitting the
argument preserves legacy single-store/mock behavior. Database creation never
accepts a local filesystem path; after a lost response repeat the same name/UUID.

Append preserves duplicates, including duplicate `key` values. There is no
upsert, delete, compaction, or asynchronous job API here. Inspect
`client.capabilities()` before relying on a service feature.

Use `examples/quickstart.py COLLECTION_UUID OPERATION_UUID` with
`GLAMDB_URL` and `GLAMDB_TOKEN` set for a runnable version of this flow. The
example does not create new UUIDs or retry a write automatically.

## Organization gateway authentication

For an organization gateway, pass its login as username and its password as
token. Set the base URL to an assigned database. See the
[organization guide](../../docs/development/ORGANIZATIONS.md) for lifecycle commands.

```python
import os
from glamdb_sdk import Client

with Client(
    "https://demo.example.com/databases/sales",
    token=os.environ["GLAMDB_ORGANIZATION_PASSWORD"],
    username="sales-team",
) as client:
    print(client.list_collections().items)
```

The gateway authenticates the credentials and checks database access on every
request. All SDK endpoint paths are relative to the base URL, so the database
prefix is preserved for metadata, writes, outcomes, JSON scans and Arrow scans.
A trailing slash on the base URL is optional. Keep credentials out of URLs.

Usernames must contain 1–64 ASCII letters, digits, underscores, dots or hyphens.
In username mode passwords may contain UTF-8 text and spaces, with no control
characters, up to bcrypt's 72-byte limit. Direct-server Bearer tokens remain
nonempty printable ASCII without whitespace. Organization authentication
requires HTTPS, with HTTP permitted only for
`localhost` or literal loopback addresses during local development. TLS
certificate verification remains enabled by default.

Without `username`, or with `username=None`, the client retains its existing
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` behavior for direct-server connections. The
organization password's 72-byte limit does not apply to Bearer tokens. Username mode
sends one Basic authorization header and does not send a Bearer header.

## Write outcomes and recovery

`append` returns `AppendOutcome` with `outcome` equal to `committed`,
`definitely_not_committed`, or `commit_unknown`. Only the first two are terminal.
`result`, `phase`, `error` and the full `raw` response remain available. An
`ErrorDetail` retains `code`, `message`, `retry_hint` and every additional field
in `error.raw`; recovery context remains in `outcome.raw`.

Unknown append/create responses must include complete, consistent recovery
contexts, including explicitly nullable candidate fields. Missing fields,
conflicting collection/operation identities, or mismatched original payload/schema
hashes raise `ProtocolError` with the original caller identity and raw response.
Blocked lookup cannot claim publication or candidate metadata/snapshots. Additional
response/recovery fields remain available in `raw`; validation does not discard them.
The [shared conformance fixtures](../../fixtures/http/README.md) exercise these
rules alongside native and browser parsing.

A committed append receipt must include a valid SHA256 digest with
`hash_version=1`, and its digest must match the frozen request. Outcome lookup
checks digest format and version without guessing the original payload. Both
paths validate shared receipt counters, version and creation timestamp, plus
physical metrics when the service supplies them. An invalid receipt raises
`ProtocolError` with the original IDs and full response; it never becomes a
fabricated failed write outcome.

`TransportError`, `DeadlineExceeded`, `ProtocolError`, `AuthenticationError`
and `HTTPError` are separate from those outcomes. A lost response or malformed
write response does not prove that publication failed. Exceptions retain the
caller operation and collection IDs when applicable. A server/gateway 5xx or 408 write
response without an authoritative outcome raises `OutcomeUnknownError` (an
`HTTPError` subclass); preserve the original IDs and reconcile or look up that
operation before deciding whether to retry. A valid pre-execution refusal
(`503 SERVER_BUSY` or `408 REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `execution_started: false`, and
`SameIdAfterReconcile`) raises ordinary `HTTPError` instead; the SDK never retries
it automatically. Missing or contradictory refusal fields remain conservative.
Database and route 404 errors never
mean an append operation is absent. The SDK does not add
credentials to error messages, and redirects are disabled.

Keep the original operation UUID, schema and input payload across a disconnect
or restart. `AppendRequest` owns a frozen JSON body and canonical v1 payload
hash. Retrying `client.append(request)` sends exactly that body and ID once;
the client performs no implicit write retry. `request.to_dict()` returns a
detached copy. After restarting, prepare the same payload with the same IDs.

`client.find_append_outcome(collection_id, operation_id)` returns the original
terminal outcome, an `OperationInProgress`, `commit_unknown`, or `None` for an
authoritative `OPERATION_NOT_FOUND`. A recovery-pending HTTP error remains an error;
it is not absence. Do not change the ID just because a response was lost or an
outcome is unknown. A terminal failed outcome may request a *new, explicit*
operation ID for a corrected attempt. A retry whose content conflicts with the
bound operation (`OPERATION_CONFLICT`/`IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`) raises
`HTTPError`; it is not an outcome of that operation, which may already be
committed. A `definitely_not_committed` reply must use an HTTP error status and
carry no recovery state, otherwise it is a `ProtocolError`.

`create_collection` requires a caller collection UUID. Its returned
`CreateOutcome.info` contains collection metadata. For a lost create response,
`resolve_create(name, schema, collection_id=original_id)` performs exact-name
lookup **and checks the original UUID and schema** (plus any original
`write_settings`, see below). A name match alone is insufficient.

The omitted `expected_snapshot` means `Any`. Pass `None` for `NoSnapshot`, or an
int64 snapshot ID for an exact precondition. The same distinction applies to
read selectors: omitted selects latest once; explicit `snapshot_id=None` selects
the initial view. Snapshot IDs are opaque int64 values, not row counts or
sequences. The SDK preserves their decimal-string wire form in metadata.

## Parquet write settings

Collections can choose the **Parquet value compression** of the data files that
later appends write. This is unrelated to HTTP transport compression
(`Content-Encoding`). Check `client.capabilities()` first:
`features.write_settings` must be true, and the top-level `parquet` object lists
the codecs of the server build with their level ranges (`level` is `null` for
codecs without levels) and `default_compression`. The development mock does not
support write settings and rejects them.

```python
settings = {"parquet": {
    "compression": {"codec": "zstd", "level": 3},  # collection default; level None = codec default
    "columns": [{"field": "at", "compression": {"codec": "uncompressed"}}],  # a field of `schema`
}}
created = client.create_collection("example", schema, collection_id=collection_id,
                                   write_settings=settings)
info = client.get_collection(collection_id)
print(info["write_settings"], info["write_settings_version"])  # canonical form, "1"

updated = client.update_write_settings(collection_id, info["write_settings_version"],
                                       {"parquet": {"compression": {"codec": "snappy"}}})
print(updated["write_settings_version"])  # "2"; existing files keep their codecs
```

Settings are plain JSON objects in the wire shape; codecs are `uncompressed`,
`snappy`, `gzip`, `lz4_raw` and `zstd`. The SDK rejects unknown keys or codecs,
non-integer levels, duplicate columns and column entries without `compression`
before sending; level ranges are checked by the server (400 `INVALID_ARGUMENT`).
`canonical_write_settings(value, schema)` returns the form the server reports:
columns in schema order, `level` explicit (`None` selects the codec's default)
and `compression` `None` when unset. Without `write_settings`, create sends
exactly the same body as before.

Write settings are part of the collection definition. Repeat a lost create with
the same value: a different value is refused with 409 `WRITE_SETTINGS_MISMATCH`.
`write_settings_version` is `"0"` for a collection created without settings and
`"1"` after a creation with non-default settings; each applied update adds one.
`create_collection` and `resolve_create(..., write_settings=...)` compare the
returned settings with the canonical request while the version is still the
creation version. A higher version means later updates replaced the creation
settings; only the UUID, name and schema remain comparable then (a version-1
collection created with defaults and updated once cannot be told apart).

`update_write_settings(collection_id, expected_version, write_settings)` is a
compare-and-set that replaces the complete settings object: it returns the
collection with version `expected_version + 1` and the requested settings,
otherwise `ProtocolError`. Reported settings may contain newer options unknown
to this SDK; unset (`null`) ones are ignored, set ones raise `ProtocolError`. A stale version raises
`HTTPError` 409 `WRITE_SETTINGS_CONFLICT`; reload the collection before deciding
again. A lost response (`TransportError`) or a 5xx such as 503
`RECOVERY_REQUIRED` (`OutcomeUnknownError`) leaves the result unknown: reconcile
if requested, then repeat the same call; an identical request that was already
applied returns the collection unchanged. File details report the codec actually
used by each column chunk as `compression`.

## Scalars, predicates and metadata

`Field(name, type, nullable=False, field_id=None)` supports `string`, `bool`,
`int64`, `float64`, and `timestamp_us_utc`. `Schema` assigns missing field IDs in
order and preserves supplied stable IDs. Append accepts Python int64 integers
or canonical decimal strings, finite floats, bools, strings, and UTC timestamps.
An omitted nullable field becomes NULL; required, unknown or mismatched fields
are rejected. Empty scan projections preserve an empty output schema and every
matching row. The SDK enforces the v0 10,000-row/16-MiB decoded append ceiling
during normalization, plus row and string limits.

Append preparation validates each row once against a cached per-schema plan
(keyed by the fields' values, never by caller data). The same pass yields the
wire object, the row's canonical hash bytes and its decoded size, and converts
each timestamp to microseconds once. Sized inputs (lists, tuples) are hashed as
they are read; for other iterables the canonical rows (bounded by the 16-MiB
ceiling) are kept until the row count is known. Generators are consumed only up
to the first limit or invalid row. To measure preparation alone:
`python sdk/python/benchmarks/prepare_bench.py` (compares against the frozen
pre-plan implementation in `sdk/python/tests/legacy_prepare.py`).

Timestamps accept timezone-aware `datetime`, RFC3339 text with a required
timezone and up to six fractional digits, or exact integer microseconds as an
`int`. Text is always parsed as RFC3339: digit-only text such as `"20260101"`
is rejected rather than read as microseconds.
Normalization uses integer arithmetic. UTC years 0001 through 9999 are allowed;
offset overflow, naive datetimes, leap seconds and excess precision are
rejected. Wire timestamps always have six fractional digits and `Z`; int64 wire
values are decimal strings. `scan_json` decodes these to Python int and aware
UTC datetime without passing through floats. NaN/infinity are rejected, bools
are not integers, and append negative zero becomes positive zero.

`col(name, logical_type)` provides `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, `in_`,
`is_null` and `is_not_null`. Combine `Predicate` values with `&`, `|`, `~`,
`and_(...)` and `or_(...)`. These serialize the public predicate tree; the
server performs SQL three-valued filtering. A typed builder prevents implicit
literal casts. A raw predicate JSON object may also be passed to scan/explain.

Read methods are `capabilities`, `list_collections`, `resolve_collection`,
`get_collection`, `get_schema`, `stats`, `snapshots`, `files`, `file`, `explain`,
`scan_json` and `scan_batches`. `Page.items`, `Page.next_cursor` and `Page.raw`
retain the server's page. Reuse the opaque cursor with exactly the same
parameters, selector and page size; do not resolve latest again between pages.

## Native selected-view metadata

These methods also operate against the native C++ service. `stats` and `explain`
retain root identity separately from the resolved selected view; the SDK checks
collection/selector consistency. `snapshot_id=None` selects initial empty,
`ANY` or omission selects latest, and a precise integer selects a retained view.
Native file IDs are opaque and usable only in a view containing that file.
`file` includes actual footer field IDs, typed bounds and row groups. Missing
physical measurements remain null; metadata/index presence is not pruning.
History and file cursors are finite, scoped and expiring. Reuse their original
parameters; a rejected token is not permission to silently restart at latest.
The [installed cross-client recipe](../../docs/development/NATIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md)
checks this SDK alongside CLI and UI on the same persistent data and restored copy.

## Streaming and transport ownership

Always use `with client.scan_batches(...) as stream:` or call `stream.close()`.
The client tracks iterators weakly. Dropping an iterator queues its HTTP owners
and cursor cleanup through a nonthrowing finalizer; GC never closes a response or
sends a request. The next client request or `Client.close()` drains that queue.
Use explicit close for prompt release: abandoned owners remain retained until a
drain, and the server cursor TTL is the fallback when no client call follows.
Breaking a loop whose iterator is retained does not immediately release it.
Exiting the context or closing the client closes every reader and HTTP
response, including on a consumer exception. Already returned Arrow batches
remain usable after those owners close. Iteration failures remain sticky: another
`next()` raises the original failure, and integrity never becomes complete.
Cleanup still attempts every owner and cursor cancellation when a close fails;
an existing consumer or protocol exception takes precedence over cleanup errors,
including when leaving the client context or rejecting a later page's view.

`scan_json`, `scan_batches` and `scan_pages` use `/scan/open` before fetching a
page, so retries and cleanup use the same known cursor even if the first page
response is lost. JSON and Arrow convenience scans support legacy single-response
adapters only when the open route explicitly returns `ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`; other
404 errors and transport failures never restart the scan. The development mock
remains a single-response adapter and does not emulate native cursor sessions.
Use `with client.scan_pages(collection_id) as pages:` to consume JSON pages
incrementally; early close cancels the continuation and keeps integrity
`not_complete`.

The response reader accepts bounded reads and keeps only a small network chunk
plus the current Arrow read; it never materializes the complete HTTP body.
`max_arrow_read_bytes` defaults to 64 MiB per Arrow read, and
`max_json_bytes` defaults to 16 MiB. These are client read bounds, not a claimed
global PyArrow allocator or process RSS limit. The service must enforce its own
batch, decompression and shared memory budgets.

`stream.integrity` starts as `not_complete`. Only full iteration through explicit
IPC EOS and HTTP EOF checks supplied byte counts and hashes. It becomes
`verified` when both `Content-Length` and `X-Content-SHA256` are present and
match. With missing integrity metadata it becomes `complete`;
`checksum_verified` is true only when a supplied SHA256 was checked. Early
close, truncation, trailing data, decode failure or digest mismatch never
claims completion. The SDK requires a fixed `X-GlamDB-Snapshot-Id` header
(`initial` for the initial view) and identity HTTP content encoding.
Before returning the first batch, its snapshot header must match an explicitly
requested snapshot and, when supplied, the snapshot selected by `/scan/open`.

TLS certificate verification is enabled by default. `verify` accepts a bool or
an `ssl.SSLContext`; disable it only when deliberately configuring a local test.
`timeout=30` supplies HTTPX connect/read/write/pool timeouts. Each operation's
optional `deadline=seconds` adds a cooperative total budget checked before and
after network reads, with the initial HTTP timeout capped by the remaining
budget. It cannot interrupt an uninterruptible OS call. A deadline is never
translated into a fabricated failed server outcome.

## Executed validation

From the repository root:

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -c sdk/python/pyproject.toml sdk/python/tests
```

The SDK tests first failed for missing codec/client/stream implementations, then
passed incrementally: 42 codec tests; 81 codec/client/predicate/request tests;
32 Arrow tests; followed by targeted failing regressions for bounded input
copying, canonical output scalars, identity on schema-fetch timeout, and closing
all streams after a close error. Receipt-validation regressions first exposed
39 failures for invalid hashes, versions and receipt fields before the fix.
The current SDK unit suite has 523 tests, including cursor abandonment, sticky
iteration failures, first-page replay, distinct operation absence and uncertain
5xx write failures. Transport doubles isolate the HTTP boundary; codec, HTTP
client logic, canonical hash and PyArrow IPC encoding/decoding are real. Native
HTTP and browser suites separately exercise the C++ server. The
canonical append hash is independently checked against fixed single-type and
all-type golden vectors. `test_prepare_plan.py` differentially checks payload
hashes, bodies and error type/message/order against that frozen pre-plan
implementation (all types, NULL/missing fields, UTF-8, int64 and timestamp
bounds, -0.0, permuted field IDs, generators, mutation after preparation).
Repository-level actual HTTP integration is maintained separately from these
isolated SDK tests:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=sdk/python/src:apps/mock_server/src:tools/verification/src \
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest -q tests/integration/test_network_sdk.py
```

All 10 actual localhost integration cases passed against subprocess mock
servers, including JSON/Arrow type round trips, immutable outcomes and views,
explicit unknown/lost-response scenarios, a dropped real HTTP response, and the
quickstart script. Actual HTTPS uses a temporary test CA: an explicitly trusted
context succeeds; system trust and an unrelated CA reject the certificate while
retaining the caller operation ID. Those tests require localhost socket access
and an OpenSSL CLI. Temporary server processes and test keys are confined to
test directories and reaped on exit. This verifies the network boundary, not
C++ storage or power-loss durability.

Native scans use fixed-view pages. `scan_json()` collects every page into one
result (caller memory grows with the full result); `scan_batches()` drains
independently checksummed Arrow pages as batches and checks the schema and
snapshot remain unchanged. Both retain compatibility with single-response
servers. Their first request starts a new scan, so a lost initial response must
be reported rather than silently restarting against a newer snapshot.

For bounded JSON consumption with safe first-page retry, use the native
`scan_pages()` API. It opens a fixed view before consuming rows and retries a
lost cursor-page response once using the same token. No write is retried:

```python
with client.scan_pages(collection_id, projection=["key", "value"]) as pages:
    for page in pages:
        consume(page.rows)
```

Closing the iterator or client cancels an unfinished scan. `cancel_scan(id,
opaque_cursor)` is also available for explicitly managed tokens. Native tokens
are database-, collection-, and representation-scoped; only the most recently
consumed page can be replayed. Inactive sessions expire after 60 seconds and
restart/close/reconcile invalidates tokens. An expired token fails explicitly;
it never restarts a scan. A failed page is an error, never a successful end of
stream. The server permits eight concurrent live sessions, so close unused
iterators promptly. Completed replay caches may be evicted to admit new scans.

Managed `create_database(name, limits={"max_collections": 2})` accepts partial
engine limits. `open_database(database_id, limits={"max_collections": 3})` changes
them for a closed database. Omit `limits` to preserve the stored configuration;
responses include all normalized limits. See the [native server contract](../../docs/development/HTTP_SERVER.md)
for ranges, retry semantics and persistence.
