# Logging validation — 2026-11-11

Executed on macOS arm64, AppleClang 21.0.0, Python 3.14.3, CMake 4.4.4,
Ninja 1.13.2 and LLVM format/tidy 18.1.8. These checks qualify the independent
logging adapters and collection pipeline, not storage durability or a native
HTTP server. The storage backend and scanner are implemented; their complete
engine validation is separate from these logging component checks.

## Replacement and regression checks

The previous native/Python queue, worker and file-rotation implementations were
replaced with Quill 13.0.0 and stdlib logging/python-json-logger 4.2.0. The old
suite passed 15 tests before replacement. New contracts were observed failing
against that implementation (standard handler ownership, truthful delivery
availability and producer registration/budgets), then passing with the real
libraries. File ownership/symlink/rotation tests were removed with application
file mode; runtime journal quotas/rotation require the separate Linux gate below.

Final executed commands/results after rebasing onto main `6264b04`:

- In a fresh non-recursive checkout and clean Python 3.13.5 environment,
  `bash scripts/bootstrap-workbench.sh` initialized only the pinned Quill
  headers; Arrow/Iceberg remained uninitialized. The original missing-header
  compiler failure was reproduced before setup. The exact workbench Python
  check then passed **429 tests**, with one Linux `/dev/full` skip, and
  `python -m pip check` reported no broken requirements.
- `cmake -S . -B build/logging-quill -G Ninja -DGLAMDB_IO_ONLY=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DPython3_EXECUTABLE="$PWD/.venv/bin/python"`,
  build, then `ctest --test-dir build/logging-quill --output-on-failure`:
  **174/174 PASS**, including **17 logging tests** (sixteen pass on macOS; the Linux ENOSPC device test skips). The logging test uses the
  actual CMake-built Quill producer. It covers success sampling/rate limits,
  errors/lifecycle, maximum typed records, eight-producer saturation, sixty-four
  sequential/churning producer attempts constrained to sixteen lifetime queues,
  blocked and closed runtime pipes, concurrent shutdown, destruction/reopen and
  cumulative process counters. Python uses actual QueueHandler/QueueListener /
  JsonFormatter with secret projection, stdout preservation, slow/full queue,
  sink-error callback and close/admission tests. A real closed pipe exposed
  CPython exit status 120 from poisoned global stderr; the unbuffered standard
  stderr stream fix was verified RED/GREEN in a child process. Slow/error Python streams are
  explicit unit doubles; native pipes and Quill are real.
- The same configure/build/CTest with `GLAMDB_ENABLE_ASAN=ON` and
  `GLAMDB_ENABLE_UBSAN=ON` in `build/logging-quill-sanitized`:
  **174/174 PASS**. This includes logger teardown/reopen and pipe failure.
- `cmake --build build/logging-quill --target format-check quality-negative-check`:
  **PASS**, LLVM 18 formatting of 75 IO-profile sources and intentional
  formatting/analyzer violations rejected. Focused LLVM 18 tidy of
  `structured_log.cpp`, `logging_probe.cpp` and CLI `main.cpp`: **PASS**, no
  project diagnostics, using the previously verified libc++ 18.1.8 source
  headers and the current SDK sysroot for analysis. The ordinary full `tidy-check`
  target cannot use this host's SDK/STL with LLVM 18 directly; that attempted run
  failed on missing standard headers and unrelated existing source diagnostics.
  It is not recorded as a passing whole-project tidy gate. A separate global
  `python3 scripts/quality.py format-check` passed all **135** project files.
- The installed-archive regression in `test_cmake_configuration.py` first
  reproduced CMake's rejection of the non-exported private Quill target.
  Keeping Quill headers in the build interface and retaining `Threads::Threads`
  fixes the static dependency boundary. The test exports and installs the actual
  `glamdb_logging` target, then builds and runs a separate consumer with its real
  adapter header and installed archive, without defining a Quill target.
  This checks component packaging; the complete engine consumer still needs
  the installed storage dependency prefix.
- Strict native CLI and engine translation-unit compilation with
  `-std=c++23 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`: **PASS**, including
  `GLAMDB_HAS_STORAGE=1` against the pinned Arrow/Iceberg source headers. CLI
  stdout generation is unchanged. A fresh full-engine configure stops at
  `find_package(SQLite3 CONFIG)`; this worktree has no installed
  Arrow/Iceberg/SQLite prefix, so no fully linked engine/CLI test is claimed.
- `cmake -P cmake/dependencies/VerifySubmodules.cmake`: **PASS**, including the
  exact Quill release commit. The installed formatter matches its pinned PyPI
  wheel. The upstream MIT/BSD licenses were inspected and dependency instructions
  updated. The Python runtime requires 3.10 or later.
- Pinned Alloy 1.21.3 `validate` of the common pipeline with each journal and
  Docker JSON source: **PASS**. Daemonless Compose 5.7.0 rendering of the base
  and optional private Grafana deployments: **PASS**. Archive SHA256s match the
  deployment lock. `py_compile` and `git diff --check`: **PASS**.

## Real ingestion and outages

The harness uses real pinned native Loki 3.7.9 and Alloy 1.21.3 binaries,
disposable child processes, unused loopback ports and a temporary directory.
The file source is explicitly a test runtime capture of stderr, not application
file logging. Actual producer output reaches the actual collector/storage.

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/logging/run-local-e2e.py \
  --loki-binary artifacts/logging-tools/loki-darwin-arm64 \
  --alloy-binary artifacts/logging-tools/alloy-darwin-arm64 \
  --probe build/logging-quill/tests/glamdb_logging_probe \
  --exercise-outage --wal-disk-threshold 0.99
```

**PASS**: ten native append-error records and one real Python-adapter event
were searchable with literal status/duration/row fields and generated correlation.
A separate synthetic raw fixture verified collector projection: password,
Authorization, Cookie, query, body, path, exception and nested secret markers were
absent from stored content; missing schema was rejected. Record labels stayed
within the finite configured set and Loki's bounded service metadata.

Restarting only the harness-owned Alloy with its state directory made new events
searchable. Stopping only its Loki exhausted finite retries and increased actual
`loki_write_dropped_entries_total` by **32**. Restarting that Loki made new native,
Python and projection fixtures searchable. Both collector-restart and
post-outage results were **PASS**. No pre-existing service was managed.
The host was above Loki's normal 90% WAL filesystem threshold, so the small
fixture used the explicit 99% test override. Production remains at 90%; this run
does not demonstrate full-disk ingestion or retention deletion timing.

## Linux sink failure proof

An isolated read-only Linux arm64 container with Python **3.13.11**, no network,
128 MiB memory and a half-CPU limit ran the actual pinned formatter and adapter
from RAM. **8/8 Python tests PASS**, including the real `/dev/full` ENOSPC device
and a closed OS pipe. Before the stream-ownership fix, `/dev/full` counted one
sink error but the interpreter exited **120**; afterward the same child emitted
`submitted=1`, `accepted=1`, `sink_errors=1` and exited **0**. No custom writer or
retry loop was added: the handler uses standard unbuffered IO on owned stderr.
The test container was removed afterward. A Linux compiler-image attempt hit
its disposable VM filesystem limit and was stopped; no native Linux compiler
qualification is claimed. Native Quill and sanitizers were tested on macOS.

## Measurement scope and costs

One local diagnostic trial compared the previous source revision
`d2ffdd2054598dcdc5055ff847e905cfa2b3b419` with the library adapters using
100,000 attempted single-thread error events and stderr attached to `/dev/null`.
Both use the same C++23 `-O2 -pthread` compiler; Python uses the same 3.14.3
interpreter. Per-call samples exclude shutdown, while CPU/RSS include the whole
process. Sample storage contributes to RSS. There was no CPU pinning or isolated
benchmark host. The queues saturate; these are attempted-admission measurements,
not end-to-end delivery latency or a production capacity claim.

Native previous p50/p95/p99 were **83/208/250 ns**; Quill was
**333/500/542 ns**. Producer elapsed time was **25,482/38,140 us**, CPU time
**55,274/107,915 us**, peak RSS **2,719,744/2,785,280 bytes**, and actual admitted
counts **11,520/8,032** (previous/library respectively). Different finite queue
representations and scheduling affect admission loss. The optimized diagnostic
executable grew from **44,568 to 461,608 bytes**; this is not an installed-engine binary comparison.

Python previous p50/p95/p99 were **8,041/9,167/15,125 ns**; stdlib logging was
**11,541/12,750/18,416 ns**. Producer elapsed time was **0.845/1.292 s**, CPU time
**1.111/1.618 s**, peak RSS **26,591,232/29,081,600 bytes**, and actual admitted
counts **4,745/9,426**. The bounded queue held 64 entries in both runs.
No speedup is claimed: the migration removes maintained infrastructure while
adding the measured library overhead.

The two implementation files shrank from **662 + 282 = 944 lines** to
**439 + 219 = 658 lines**. Tests/configuration/docs are additional; the upstream
Quill source and dependency footprint are not counted as removed project code.

## Remaining runtime/operator gates

- Real journald quota/rotation, Docker json-file rotation and native sink ENOSPC
  remain pending. Python's real Linux `/dev/full` behavior is verified above;
  it does not establish a runtime journal's retention or native Linux behavior.
  Use a task-owned capped volume, emit beyond the configured runtime limit,
  restart the collector and verify both retained bytes and new-event search.
- Docker deployment containers and private Grafana were rendered but not started
  in this run. Grafana login, remote TLS/authentication and multi-node retention
  remain deployment checks. Local Loki/Alloy ingestion was real.
- Native output has no exact delivered/backlog metric. Quill callback drop
  reports are delayed and duplicate the queue-loss observation; their count is
  never added to queue rejection. Runtime/collector loss can occur after a
  successful application admission and needs independent monitoring.
- A permanently blocked OS sink can delay graceful shutdown. Producer admission
  remains bounded; this suite releases its deliberate pipe block before joining.
  Join workers before object destruction; restart the process to obtain a new
  lifetime producer-allocation budget after worker churn exhausts sixteen slots.
