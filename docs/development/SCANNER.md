# Storage backend and scanner MVP

`core/backend/` connects the coordinator seam in `core/engine/storage_backend.h`
to the [durable storage primitives](STORAGE_MODULE.md). `core/scan/` implements
the public `Engine::Scan` declared in `public/storage/scan.h`. Both are built
when `GLAMDB_BUILD_STORAGE=ON`, the default unless `GLAMDB_IO_ONLY=ON`. Without
them the public factories install no backend and collection creation, appends
and scans report `DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The bridge and scanner are built and tested against the pinned Arrow, Parquet,
> Iceberg, and SQLite dependencies (`glamdb_unit` and `glamdb_vertical`).
> Full-engine sanitizer runs and power-loss qualification remain separate steps.
> See [Validation status](#validation-status).

## Write path

`CreateStore`/`OpenExisting` construct `TLocalStorageBackend` after the store
lease has created or validated `root/` and `warehouse/`
(`EngineFactory::CreateWith/OpenWith`). The internal factories that take a
ready backend remain for coordinator tests.

- **Create:** `MakeTableProfile` maps the fixed `SchemaSpec` (field IDs 1..N).
  The backend creates the collection directories, binds a `CreateCollection`
  attempt, writes `metadata/00000-<attempt>.metadata.json` through the durable
  FileIO and returns the Iceberg table UUID. `Publish` inserts the
  `columnar.<exact name>` pointer; the catalog guard runs
  `TStoragePublicationGuard` before that insert.
- **Append:** normalized coordinator rows are converted into one owned Arrow
  batch, so stored values are exactly the hashed canonical content. The backend
  writes `data/<operation>-<attempt>-00000.parquet`, stages a fast append with
  summary keys `glamdb.operation-id` and `glamdb.content-hash`, and writes the
  next numbered root. `Publish` is one CAS from the exact prepared root. The
  receipt carries the staged snapshot ID, parent, row count, one data file, its
  size and the snapshot timestamp in microseconds.
- `iceberg::Table` requires a catalog; the backend passes `TInertCatalog`,
  whose every operation fails, so no Iceberg commit can bypass the coordinator.
- Guard candidates are tentative until the coordinator confirms the outer
  SQLite `COMMIT` via `ConfirmPublication` (or a later binding/recovery
  observes the committed root). Rollback discards the tentative candidate.
- `VerifyRetained` runs the full `VerifyReachable` closure check for every
  collection root (manifest lists, manifests, data file lengths and Parquet
  footers), its schema, a one-to-one mapping between retained snapshots and
  committed receipts, and the aggregate multi-collection store usage against
  `TStorageLimits::Store`. It runs on open, `Reconcile()` and every identical
  create retry. An idempotent retry of a committed append runs
  `VerifyCommittedAppend` instead: the collection's committed root, the
  receipt's snapshot (its transition from the parent, manifest list, new
  manifest and Parquet footer) and the receipt fields, so the retry never
  returns a committed outcome over missing or corrupt files of that append
  without re-reading unrelated history. A retry of a failed outcome reads no
  storage. Missing or inconsistent committed state is `CORRUPTION`, which
  closes readiness.
- After a committed append the backend removes the superseded root
  (`RetireRoot`). The engine defers it while a scan that resolved that root is
  still planning; a root that cannot be removed remains an orphan. Removal
  runs only on the writer (after the next committed append, or at shutdown):
  capacity preflight walks the warehouse on the writer, and a root unlinked
  mid-walk would fail that walk as corruption. A finishing scan only ends its
  lease.
- Corruption reports and publication are ordered by the engine's commit gate.
  The writer takes it immediately before the guard's final health decision and
  holds it through the outer `COMMIT`; a reader that detects corruption takes
  it before closing readiness. Corruption observed before that decision rolls
  the publication back; corruption observed after it is surfaced only once the
  publication has completed.

`CheckAppendAdmissible` runs before the coordinator binds the operation in
SQLite, so a rejection consumes no operation ID and writes no file. It checks
writer row/byte limits (1..10000 rows, 2 MiB per row including fixed slot
headers for `NULL` cells, 16 MiB Arrow buffers, estimated without building a
batch), the warehouse preflight, the exact base root against
`TStorageLimits::RootBytes` and `MetadataLogEntries`, and the minimum store
usage increment of one append. Exactly one Arrow batch is built per append.
Limits that only the produced files reveal (`MaxFileBytes`, candidate root
size, aggregate usage) fail after binding as `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` with
`OperatorAction`; the ID stays permanently failed. The default storage limits
require free-space reserves (see `TStorageLimits`). Orphan files from failed
attempts remain.

A failed durable write sets the backend's write latch for this engine
instance, as does identity evidence from the store-root probe (a replaced,
missing or redirected root). Transient resource errors of that probe, such as
descriptor or memory exhaustion, fail only the current call. The latch blocks
further writes with `IO_ERROR`/`OperatorAction` before binding; verification,
scans, `Reconcile()` and `Shutdown()` remain available. Shut down and reopen
the store to write again.

### Error classification

Storage failures map to engine codes as follows. Read paths only use locations
taken from committed metadata, so malformed or missing persisted state there
is corruption; environmental read failures (I/O errors, descriptor or memory
exhaustion) keep their own codes and do not close readiness. Manifest lists
and manifests are read whole through the FileIO before Avro decoding, so a
read error cannot surface as a truncated, apparently malformed file. Every
`CORRUPTION` closes readiness.

| Source | Condition | Engine code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `state_not_recoverable`, ELOOP (symlink with `O_NOFOLLOW`), `not_a_directory`, `cross_device_link`, `no_such_file_or_directory` | any store path | `CORRUPTION` |
| `invalid_argument` | warehouse preflight (symlink or special file) or opening a committed file that is not regular | `CORRUPTION` |
| `file_too_large` | reading a committed file / write budget | `CORRUPTION` / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` |
| `no_space_on_device`, `value_too_large`, `not_enough_memory` | any | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` |
| write latch, `io_error`, `read_only_file_system`, `permission_denied`, other | any | `IO_ERROR` |
| Iceberg `kIOError` without a prefix | read paths | `IO_ERROR` |
| Iceberg `kInvalid`, `kInvalidArgument`, `kNotFound`, `kValidationFailed`, `kDecompressError`, `kUnknownError`, `kInvalidManifest(List)`, `kInvalidSchema`, `kJsonParseError`; decoder exceptions | read paths | `CORRUPTION` |
| `std::bad_alloc`, Arrow `OutOfMemory`, message prefix `RESOURCE: ` (including a full recovery workspace) | any | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` |
| message prefix `CORRUPTION: ` | any | `CORRUPTION` |
| message prefix `CAPACITY: ` | write paths / read paths | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / `CORRUPTION` |

An `invalid_argument` from a `statfs` anomaly in the preflight is not
distinguishable from a planted special file and also fails closed.

## Scan path

`Engine::Scan` validates the collection, resolves the confirmed SQLite view
once, and opens a cursor through the backend's read-only FileIO view; it never
joins a writer attempt or holds a SQLite read transaction.

- `SnapshotSelector`: `Latest` (resolved at open), `Id`, `InitialEmpty`.
  `ScanInfo.selector_resolved` reports `Id(snapshot)` or `InitialEmpty`.
- Opening a scan reads the committed root and the selected manifest list; the
  cursor reads each manifest's live entries only when it needs the next data
  file, so `limit = 0` reads no manifest and a small limit reads only the
  manifests it consumes. A malformed manifest therefore surfaces from
  `Next()` (still `CORRUPTION`, closing readiness). Warehouse directories are
  never listed. Delete manifests,
  partitioned specs and non-Parquet files are `UNSUPPORTED_TABLE_FEATURE`.
- `Predicate` supports `True` and one comparison (`Eq`, `Ne`, `Lt`, `Le`, `Gt`,
  `Ge`) of a field with a literal of exactly the field type. A NULL cell is
  UNKNOWN and never returned, which equals SQL three-valued logic for a single
  comparison. Strings compare by unsigned UTF-8 bytes; literal `-0.0` matches
  stored `0.0`; NaN/Inf and out-of-range timestamps are `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- Each file is read whole (at most 32 MiB in this profile) and its footer is
  checked by the same verifier as recovery: exact field IDs 1..N, names,
  repetition, physical/logical types, row group counts and the manifest row
  count. Before any value is returned, every decoded column is validated:
  Arrow `ValidateFull` (offsets and UTF-8), string limits (1024 bytes for
  `key`, 1 MiB otherwise), finite non-negative-zero floats and timestamps in
  years 0001..9999. Then rows are filtered, projected and limited. Batches have at most
  `batch_rows` rows and the exact `Info().output_schema`. `limit = 0` and empty
  views return `nullptr` from the first `Next()`.
- Both the cursor and returned Arrow buffers retain the store lease until the
  last dependent handle (including array slices and C Data exports) is
  released. `Cancel()` or `Engine::Shutdown()` makes `Next()` return
  `CANCELLED`; `Info()` remains valid. Detected corruption during `Next()`
  closes engine readiness. Read failures are errors, never EOS.

Not implemented: file/row-group pruning, compound predicates (`And`, `Or`,
`Not`, `In`, `IsNull`), reuse of the backend's parsed root by scans,
runtime memory leases and quotas,
page CRC verification, per-device physical/inode budgets and in-flight
reservations, and measured attempt-volume/capacity qualification.
The [shared resource budget contract](RESOURCE_BUDGETS.md) defines the required
memory accounting lifetime for retained buffers and the process/store ownership
of reader, writer, metadata and recovery reservations.

## Validation status

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `cmake --build --preset local` (Clang 18.1.3, `GLAMDB_BUILD_STORAGE=ON`) and `format-check`, `quality-negative-check` | PASS |
| `ctest --preset local` (unit, mock, vertical, fault, integration including `glamdb.scan_process`, installed consumer, tooling, smoke) | PASS, see the PR description for counts; the standalone `RecoveryChildProcess` helper is skipped as expected |
| `glamdb_vertical` (`engine_vertical_test.cpp`, `engine_integrity_test.cpp`) | PASS: commit-gate boundaries, layout violations, retry verification, crafted same-length Parquet corruption, quotas, write latch |
| `glamdb_mock` (label `mock`, in-memory FileIO) | PASS, also from a read-only working/temporary directory |
| Separate `GLAMDB_BUILD_STORAGE=OFF` build and CTest | PASS |
| Full-repo `tidy-check`, sanitizer presets, TSan, power-loss qualification | NOT RUN in this change |

Value validation reads only decoded columns of the projection and predicate;
latent corruption in unread columns or unread data pages is not detected by
`VerifyReachable`, which checks footers rather than every page.
