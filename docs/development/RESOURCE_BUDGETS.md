# Shared resource budgets

The embedded engine and native HTTP service need shared budgets as well as
individual request limits. This contract defines the accounting units, owners,
reservation lifetimes and refusal rules for the synchronous append profile.
It complements the [HTTP contract](HTTP_SERVER.md) and its
[v0 wire fixtures](../../fixtures/http/v0.json), established by issue #29.

The integration baseline is merged [PR #19](https://github.com/glamourdb/glamdb/pull/19):
final head `ee480ec9a10ab3d6baabf9b5296accf57a82adba`, merge
`87b557e4685331c99666370c52a40aaa505f0d71`. The matrices below were checked
against the subsequent health/API baseline `4e53c89`. **Current** means an
implemented local check, not a qualified simultaneous resource guarantee.
**Required** identifies enforcement still needed before a profile can claim a
bounded process. This document does not add configuration fields or runtime
quotas. Full-engine memory, capacity and durability qualification remain open.

## Accounting units

MiB means 2^20 bytes; GiB means 2^30; TiB means 2^40. Counts, durations,
logical bytes, allocated memory and physical disk usage are separate units.

| Quantity | Definition and boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Canonical decoded bytes | Per field: one validity byte; for a non-NULL value add one byte for bool, eight for int64/float64/timestamp, or four length bytes plus UTF-8 string bytes. Sum fields into rows and rows into the append; exclude the canonical hash header. Omitted nullable fields count as NULL. Independent of Arrow chunking and HTTP encoding. |
| Owned-input reservation | `4 * decoded_bytes + rows * (2 * sizeof(Row) + fields * sizeof(Cell)) + 65536`, from `InputReservation`. A conservative admission estimate for normalized rows, hashing and rebuilt Arrow input; not measured RSS or a writer/reader allocation cap. |
| Physical memory | Allocated capacities, allocator rounding and live parent buffers, including Arrow validity/offset/value buffers, builder growth, STL cells/strings, codecs, Parquet, Avro, Iceberg, JSON and SQLite. Slices can retain an entire parent allocation. |
| Writer input bytes | The backend estimates the Arrow batch it will build; the writer separately checks its buffers and row groups. NULL fixed-width slots, offsets and bitmaps differ from canonical bytes. Its 16 MiB cap does not redefine canonical input size. |
| Wire bytes | UTF-8 HTTP request/response body bytes, including JSON keys, escaping and decimal strings, or a complete Arrow IPC page with schema and EOS. Header bytes have a separate cap. Compressed and chunked requests are rejected in the current profile. |
| Disk bytes | Warehouse traversal counts the larger of logical length and allocated blocks for regular files, directory blocks, and hard links per entry; includes orphans. Catalog pages, rollback journal and recovery workspace are separate charges. |

The [canonical inspector and reservation](../../core/api/arrow_input.cpp),
[backend preflight](../../core/backend/local_storage_backend.cpp) and
[writer](../../core/storage/data_file_writer.cpp) enforce different checks.
A canonical batch that fits can still fail the writer or transport cap. The
HTTP adapter allocates JSON and Arrow input before `AppendDurable`; the core's
owned-input reservation does not cover those allocations. Embedded callers own
their immutable input buffers for the synchronous call; the host application
must budget those buffers separately.

## Shared memory and admission matrix

A bounded deployment must have a process owner (the embedding host or HTTP
service) whose budgets cover every open store and every surviving lease. Store
sub-budgets cannot each independently spend the full process allowance. The
symbols below describe the required accounting contract, not existing public
`Limits` members. Finite numeric data/metadata/control envelopes need measured
profiles; the current implementation has no aggregate caps for these classes.

| Budget / unit | Scope and owner | Reservation, enforcement and release | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data memory `D`, allocated bytes | Process parent; engine writer and scanner children; transport decode/encode children | Reserve before allocation for input copies, Parquet buffers, decompression, filtering, output batches and IPC/JSON assembly. Keep simultaneous copies charged. Transfer accounting with ownership; release only when the last owning buffer is freed. | Required; Arrow default pools and the owned-input estimate do not enforce `D`. |
| Metadata memory `M`, allocated bytes | Process parent; catalog, backend, planner and recovery children | Charge materialized roots/history, manifest lists/entries, schemas, metrics, footer parsing, caches and SQLite memory before loading or growing them. Retain charges with plans/caches; lazy file iteration alone is insufficient. | Required; file/count caps below bound persisted inputs, not decoder expansion or combined metadata RAM. |
| Control memory `C`, allocated bytes | Process parent; engine coordinator and service admission children | Charge operation/recovery contexts, pending-call descriptors, tasks, timers and error/receipt serialization. Partition ordinary admission, completion and recovery capacity; ordinary requests cannot borrow the protected partitions. Release with the last descriptor/context. | Required; worker and call counts are current checks, not a byte budget. |
| Completion reserve, bytes and slots within `C` plus execution memory/disk | Coordinator owns an admitted attempt; catalog and backend consume its child reservations | Before durable binding, reserve enough to finish or durably record failure, retain an unknown context, perform checked close and emit a bounded outcome. Keep it through publication/failure recording or transfer it to reconciliation. Disconnect never releases an executing attempt's reserve. | Current catalog headroom check: 24,576 reusable/growable page bytes before binding/creation. General memory/slot reservations are required. |
| Recovery reserve, memory bytes, workspace disk bytes and control slots | Process parent grants an engine recovery child before open/reconciliation | Protect root/catalog validation, retained-history traversal, durability fence and resolution of unfinished bindings from normal data admission. Retain through recovery, including uncertainty; release temporary workspace after its last handle closes. | Current workspace: temporary SQLite database at most 256 MiB with eight 4 KiB cache pages. Shared recovery memory, filesystem reservations and process-wide recovery concurrency are required. |
| Shared pending calls `P`, count | Process admission owner with per-store children and separate control/recovery slots | Reserve before posting or entering work; include queued and executing calls across every API/store. Hold until the underlying call finishes, even if its caller disconnects. Data calls cannot spend protected lookup/recovery slots. | Required across independent embedded engines; current HTTP dispatch counts are listed below. |
| Owned input, estimated bytes | Per store, shared across collections; `Engine::Impl` | `max_owned_input_bytes` defaults to 128 MiB. Reserve under the state mutex after writer acquisition and original-outcome lookup, before normalization; the append admission guard releases it when the synchronous call exits. | Current; only new operations consume this reservation. |
| Pending append calls, count | Per store, shared across collections; coordinator | `max_pending_calls` defaults to 16, including the writer and queued calls. Admission guard decrements on exit, including failures. Fingerprinting precedes this admission and is not process-wide concurrency control. | Current; shared admission for other embedded calls and across stores is required. |
| Writer wait / append deadline, milliseconds | Per store configuration; coordinator | Defaults/maxima: 5,000 / 60,000. Bound writer waiting and check the append deadline before execution/publication. Neither forcibly interrupts OS I/O nor proves rollback. | Current. |
| Returned buffers and active scans, allocated bytes / cursor count | Scanner and caller share a lease; process/store data and metadata children | Charge retained results, slices and C Data exports even after cursor cancellation, engine shutdown or release of the engine object. Charge backing allocations once; charge copies separately. Release buffer charges only on final buffer destruction. | Current store-ownership leases; runtime memory leases, embedded scan-count quotas and byte quotas are required. |

[`Limits`](../../public/storage/types.h),
[`Engine::AppendDurable`](../../core/engine/engine.cpp),
[`DurableSqliteCatalogStore`](../../core/catalog/durable_sqlite_catalog.cpp),
[`TRecoveryVisited`](../../core/storage/recovery_visited.cpp) and
[`TLeaseBuffer`](../../core/scan/scan_cursor.cpp) are the current enforcement
and lifetime boundaries. The host must retain the accounting parent as long as
any dependent allocation survives, including after a database is closed.

Reservations must be atomic at the shared parent, overflow checked and released
on every refusal/exception path. Use one class owner per allocation; transfers
must not create an uncharged interval or double-credit the parent. Conservatively
reserve an upper bound when an upstream allocator cannot be charged directly,
and refuse before starting that work if the bound is unavailable. A future
process-memory limit must include simultaneous data, metadata, control and
untracked runtime overhead; `max_owned_input_bytes` alone is not that limit.

## Input and transport matrix

All rows below are **Current** local checks. Their owners must become children
of the shared budgets above to bound combined usage. CLI, SDK and UI requests
use these same server checks; their own client memory belongs to their process.

| Limit / unit | Bound and scope | Owner and enforcement / release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canonical input, rows / batches / bytes | Per append: 1..10,000 rows; at most 10,000 Arrow batches; 2 MiB per row; 16 MiB per append; strings 1 MiB, `key` 1,024 bytes | Core `Inspect`/fingerprint before binding. Deterministic validation, not a reservation. |
| Writer row / input / row group / output file, bytes | Per append: separate 2 MiB row estimate; 16 MiB Arrow input; 8 MiB row group target/bound; 32 MiB Parquet file | Backend preflight counts a validity byte plus typed slot bytes even for NULL fields, unlike canonical rows. It checks estimated input before binding; writer and durable FileIO check production. File-size failure after binding retains a failed operation. Not a cap on transient writer allocations. |
| Scan batch, rows | `batch_rows` 1..65,536 per cursor | Core scan creation validates; cursor may retain a whole input file up to 32 MiB plus decoded/transformed buffers. A row cap is not a byte reservation. |
| HTTP header / body, bytes | 16 KiB header; 16 MiB request body | Session header parsing, Content-Length validation and bounded body read. Release buffers when the session and outstanding worker references finish. JSON parsing adds up to 32 nesting levels and 5,200,000 parser events, not a DOM-memory quota. |
| HTTP response / page, bytes and rows | 16 MiB body; scan page at most 10,000 rows, soft target 4 MiB | Route serializers and bounded IPC output prepare the complete body before success headers. A single row may exceed the soft target if the complete envelope fits. Hold outgoing copies through write completion/timeout. |
| HTTP connections / header readers / bodies, counts | Per service: 96 connections by default, including overload replies; 64 header readers, at most 32 per peer; 16 admitted nonempty bodies | `TState`/`TSession`; release reader count after headers, body count at session finish, connection at final release. Accept pauses at the connection ceiling. Counts exclude kernel backlog/buffer accounting. |
| HTTP admitted calls, counts | Per service: 4 data calls, at most 2 per database; 8 control calls on 2 workers; 2 lifecycle calls on 2 workers | Dispatch increments before posting; completion/finish decrements. Separate pools protect control progress but do not reserve completion memory. Health/capabilities observations run on the I/O thread. |
| HTTP scan sessions, count / time | 64 per service, at most 8 per database; 60 s idle / 300 s lifetime | `TScans`; release on cancellation, expiry, failed page, database lifecycle drain or shutdown. Replay does not refresh idle expiry. Returned/in-flight resources can outlive session removal. |
| Retained replay bodies, serialized bytes | Shared 128 MiB per service | `TScans::Charge` replaces each session's body charge under its shared mutex; eviction/cancel/expiry releases it. Completed replays may be evicted. Does not account for pending Arrow batches, response copies, headers, schema/JSON objects or allocator capacity. |
| Database descriptors, count | 64 per managed service | `TDatabases::Create` under its shared mutex; persisted registry entries include closed/error databases. This is not a cap on the total memory or disk of their stores. |

[scan sessions](../../apps/server/scans.cpp),
[database registry](../../apps/server/databases.cpp) and
[writer limits](../../core/storage/data_file_writer.h).
Sixteen 16 MiB request bodies alone can occupy 256 MiB of logical payload;
decoded JSON, Arrow input, active responses and other databases add to that.
The replay cap cannot be used as a bound on total scan or process memory.

## Persistent capacity and disk matrix

These are **Current** development defaults, shared across collections where
marked store-wide, except the device-wide reservation row marked **Required**.
Only public `Limits` fields are configurable through the
HTTP database `limits` object; private storage/FileIO/attempt limits are not
additional HTTP settings. Persistent charges do not disappear when a call ends.

| Limit / unit | Bound and scope | Owner and enforcement / release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Catalog collections / operations, counts | Store-wide `max_collections=8`, `max_operations=4096`; operations include bound, committed and failed records | Catalog capacity check before insert, plus reopen validation. Bindings/outcomes do not expire; closing a store does not refund them. An operation ID is collection-scoped but the cap covers all collections. |
| Catalog database, page bytes | Store-wide `max_catalog_bytes=256 MiB`, rounded down to whole SQLite pages; minimum configuration 64 KiB | Working connection `max_page_count` and page-count check on open; 24,576 bytes of freelist/growth headroom before a binding or collection creation. Excludes journal, service registry and SQLite heap/cache; catalog cache target is 8 MiB per connection. |
| Individual metadata files, serialized bytes | Root JSON 16 MiB; manifest 8 MiB; manifest list 16 MiB | Durable FileIO size checks and publication/recovery validation. Keep the disk charge for retained files and orphans. |
| Aggregate current roots, bytes | Store-wide 64 MiB | Backend aggregate usage and publication guard; root replacement subtracts the previous root before adding the candidate. Superseded roots held by a planning scan still count as physical warehouse usage. |
| Retained snapshots / snapshot-log entries / manifests / data files, counts | Store-wide 4,096 / 4,096 / 4,096 / 16,384 | Publication guard and `VerifyRetained` aggregate `TStorageUsage` across collections. Per-collection metadata log cap 4,096, at most 8 new manifests per commit. Retained history is not expired to make room. |
| Retained manifest / manifest-list / footer bytes | Store-wide 256 MiB / 512 MiB / 256 MiB | Guard and recovery count retained serialized structures. These are persisted-structure limits, not shared metadata-memory reservations. |
| Commit verification, bytes | 32 MiB per commit | Publication guard and recovery use matching commit accounting. Recovery charges each retained commit's manifests/list and only the final current root to its current commit, not all history to one commit. |
| Attempt new-file / I/O volume, bytes | 256 MiB new files; 512 MiB requested reads plus writes per attempt, including retries | `TIOAttempt` reserves requested writes before I/O and settles new-file usage to accepted bytes, refunding unused file capacity. Requested I/O stays charged even on failure. Handles retain their originating attempt. Attempt completion does not refund physical files left behind. Not a process memory or device-space reservation. |
| Warehouse, physical bytes | 1 TiB per store, including orphans; admit only if another 256 MiB attempt fits | Backend preflight measures warehouse before binding and reuses that measurement for the same append, rechecking identity/free space before production. Successful removal of an eligible superseded root releases its disk use; no general orphan cleanup. |
| Filesystem headroom / attempt / journal, available bytes | `max(1 GiB, ceil(filesystem_capacity / 20)) + 256 MiB + 256 MiB` | `CheckDiskReserve` compares against available space. This is a preflight check, not filesystem preallocation or a shared reservation across databases/processes. Preserve journal/recovery room when rejecting new writes. |
| Recovery workspace, page bytes | Temporary SQLite database at most 256 MiB per verifier | Recovery owns it outside catalog/warehouse accounting. Its temporary filesystem needs space independently of the store volume; workspace exhaustion fails recovery. Close removes the temporary database. |
| Shared device capacity, allocated bytes and inodes | **Required** finite device-wide profile covering stores, catalog/journals, service registry and temporary workspaces on that device | Process/device admission owner must atomically reserve concurrent attempt and recovery growth before work, convert successful writes to retained usage, and release only unused reservations or successfully removed files. Current independent free-space checks do not provide this shared reservation. |

[attempt reservations](../../core/io/io_attempt.cpp) and
[storage validation](STORAGE_MODULE.md).
Shared per-device byte/inode reservations across stores, attempts and recovery
workspaces are **Required**. The service registry, catalog/journal growth and
temporary volume need their own charges in that parent. Independent `statfs`
checks cannot prevent stores on the same volume from spending the same space;
external ENOSPC/EIO must still propagate through the durable outcome protocol.

## Admission, release and errors

For new work the required order is process/store admission, transport decode
reservation, core validation and original-outcome lookup, execution and
completion/recovery reservations, durable operation binding, production, then
guarded publication. The current coordinator already returns a known terminal
retry before reserving owned input, checking a new snapshot precondition or
consuming another permanent operation slot. Keep that ordering when adding
shared budgets. Lookup and reconciliation need protected control capacity.

Returning, cancelling or disconnecting releases only resources actually no
longer owned. The writer owns an admitted publication through its known outcome
or recovery-required state. Retained Arrow buffers and HTTP replay/outgoing
copies keep their own charges. Failure does not delete operation bindings,
receipts, retained snapshots or orphan files. Resource pressure by itself does
not latch corruption or change readiness.

| Refusal boundary | Core/transport result and HTTP mapping | Identity and retry rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Header/body/canonical size or invalid shape before binding | `HEADERS_TOO_LARGE` 431; `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` / `INPUT_TOO_LARGE` 413 with `FixInput`; invalid row/batch/string shape `INVALID_ARGUMENT` 400 | Reject this input without binding an ID. A rejection of this call says nothing about a previous call with the same ID. |
| Writer row/input estimate before binding | Current `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` with `FixInput` maps to 429, including a canonical-valid row/batch that exceeds the separate writer estimate | Reduce/change input; this is a deterministic input refusal, not transient shared admission. No ID is bound. Follow the core hint rather than assuming every 429 permits unchanged input. |
| Transient shared admission | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` / `DATABASE_BUSY` 429 where no outcome override applies; HTTP worker/body/connection overload `SERVER_BUSY` 503 with `Retry-After: 1` when a response can be admitted | Preserve original identity. Pending-call or writer-wait refusal first tries authoritative outcome lookup; unresolved lookup is `CommitUnknown` (503), not proof of absence. |
| Owned-input, catalog, disk or produced-file capacity / allocation failure | Core `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` with `OperatorAction` maps to 507; `CAPACITY_EXCEEDED` also maps to 507 | Before binding, no new binding; after binding, a proven failure is permanently recorded. Same ID returns that terminal failure, not a fresh attempt. Do not treat every 507 as retryable overload. |
| Transport response/replay capacity | Current adapter `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` uses the transport retry policy (429); a failed scan page invalidates its session | This is not a core append disposition. Preserve a write's ID and resolve its outcome if its response is lost or cannot be encoded. |
| Cannot prove binding/publication/failure-recording outcome | `CommitUnknown`, normally 503 with `SameIdAfterReconcile`, complete recovery context | Hold the write barrier and reconcile/fence before new writes. Exhausting a reserve, timing out or losing a socket cannot turn uncertainty into `DefinitelyNotCommitted`. |
| Open under insufficient configured limits | Catalog `CONFIG_TOO_SMALL` (HTTP 400); persisted storage violations follow the [storage error classification](SCANNER.md#error-classification) | Fail closed without pruning history, dropping receipts or rewriting the store. Restore an adequate profile and reopen; failure does not authorize creating an empty replacement. |

Mappings are owned by [the transport error policy](../../apps/transport/errors.h)
and [durable outcome serializer](../../apps/transport/outcome_json.cpp).
Core retry hints and authoritative dispositions take precedence over a generic
status-code retry rule.

## Publication and reopening

An accepted committed state must reopen under the same profile and limits,
including all collections, retained snapshots, permanent failed outcomes and
required recovery workspace. Validate the complete candidate against the same
units on both paths before changing the catalog pointer. Replacing a root is
not an extra retained root; validating retained history is not one giant new
commit. Equality at a limit must be accepted wherever publication accepted it.

The managed service persists public engine limits in its registry and reuses
them on restart. It changes limits only while a database is closed. Embedded
callers must supply the same limits on `OpenExisting`; the profile ID alone
does not persist their custom `Limits` values. Lower limits may reject open,
but must preserve the original state and identity. Future global governors
must also reserve recovery capacity before opening stores, not admit data
until recovery fits, and retain parents for buffers surviving close.

## Validation boundaries

Documentation checks should verify source constants, ownership and local links.
Existing focused executable coverage is separated below; it does not establish
the required aggregate memory/device reservations or peak-RSS guarantees.

| Evidence layer | Existing checks |
| --- | --- |
| Coordinator with test backend, real SQLite | `tests/unit/coordinator_test.cpp`, `tests/fault/pending_budget_owner_test.cpp`: pending writer accounting, owned-input refusal, terminal retry under lower limits, uncertainty during admission. The backend is a double, not a native Parquet writer. |
| Native storage components | `StorageCapacity`, `TWriteCapacityTest`, `IoAttempt`, publication/recovery tests: exact caps, cross-collection usage, arithmetic overflow, orphan accounting, attempt/journal reserves and same-limit reopening. |
| Real public engine and dependencies | `EngineVerticalTest` retained-buffer and multi-collection capacity cases; `BackendRecoveryLimitsTest.ReopenAcceptsHistoryPublishedUnderTheSameCommitBytes`: real Parquet/Avro/JSON and SQLite, lease lifetime, publication/reopen accounting. |
| Real HTTP service | `glamdb.database_limits`, `glamdb.http_review`, `glamdb.scan_http`: persisted/lowered profiles, capacity status, socket admission, page/replay/session limits, cancellation and expiry. SDK/Arrow cases require their Python dependencies. |

For a full configured dependency build, discover and run the focused cases with:

```sh
cmake --build --preset local --target glamdb_unit glamdb_fault glamdb_io_test \
    glamdb_storage_test glamdb_vertical glamdb_server glamdb_cli --parallel 2
ctest --preset local --output-on-failure --no-tests=error \
    -R 'Coordinator|PendingBudget|StorageCapacity|WriteCapacity|IoAttempt|BackendRecoveryLimits|EngineVerticalTest|glamdb\.(database_limits|http_review|scan_http)$'
```

Future governor acceptance also needs deterministic combined-load tests across
stores and collections: simultaneous writer/reader/transport allocations,
retained slices after shutdown, ordinary admission exhausted while completion
and recovery succeed, and colliding disk/workspace reservations on one device.
Measure actual allocation peaks/RSS and cold reopen under the same profile.
Mock-only or independent per-request checks cannot close those gates.
